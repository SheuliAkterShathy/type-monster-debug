            <h2>Question 2:: What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h2> 
            <p>Answer: In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object , it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.'Let' and 'const' provide Block Scope in JavaScript.Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</p>

            <h2>Question 3:: How Event loop works in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>Answer: The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
